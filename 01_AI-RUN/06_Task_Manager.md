# Task Management Process

The primary documentation for the project's task management process, including workflow with Roo Orchestrator/Code and the structure of `tasks/tasks.json`, has been moved.

Please refer to the new centralized documentation here:
- **Main Workflow:** [`../../02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.md`](../../02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.md)
- **`tasks.json` Structure:** [`../../02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.md`](../../02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.md)

This file (`01_AI-RUN/06_Task_Manager.md`) is now deprecated for detailed information.
